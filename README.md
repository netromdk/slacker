# slacker
Slacker is a tool designed to make it easier to do admin tasks and general utility for several workspaces (teams). It supports a REPL for inputting and evaluating commands, along with a CLI for running a single command.

# First Run
The first invocation of Slacker requires to setup a workspace using the `--init` argument:
```
% ./slacker.py --init
Input workspace token: ****************************************************************************
Added new workspace 'myworkspace' to config and made it active.
You can now run slacker normally.
myworkspace>
```

Slacker is ready for use afterwards with "myworkspace" as the active workspace. _Note that it is recommended to employ a user token, not a bot token!_

Tokens can be created [here](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens). _Never share these tokens!_

# CLI Usage
```
usage: slacker.py [options] [-- command [args..]]

Useful Slack utilities and REPL.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -V, --version  show program's version number and exit
  -v, --verbose  Sets the log level to DEBUG for this session.
  -q, --quiet    Disable stdout logging
  --init         Interactively initialize config and add workspace and API
                 token.
  --check        Checks that all commands are valid.
  --no-tests     Do not do API and auth tests at startup.

Most commands support -h|--help to see how they work. By passing '--', it
signals that Slacker arguments end and a single command and arguments begin.
Slacker will exit after running that command.

# Development Environment
Slacker is written in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and the required modules to be installed can be found in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

To setup a virtual development environment that doesn't pollute the general system it is expected that [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) for Python 3+ is installed.

Run `make setup` to install required modules to ".venv" in the root of the repository, and issue `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate the environment. From here, the `python`, `python3`, `pip` etc. will map to ".venv" and the modules installed into it.

# Docker
A Dockerfile is provided to quickly get up an running with Slacker. To build the Docker image it is recommended to use the `docker` target in the Makefile `make docker`, which creates image `slacker:local`. Start the slacker container by executing `docker_run.sh`. By default the script will drop you into the REPL, but slacker commands can be given directly to the script.

```
% ./docker_run.sh -- files.list -c 10
```

> **Note:** slacker writes a configuration file to disk (`~/.slacker`). In order to keep the configuration file between subsequent runs the local volume mount in the container is required.
